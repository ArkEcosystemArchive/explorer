# ARK Block Explorer

> A redesigned frontend of ARK Blockchain Explorer using AngularJS and TypeScript.

You can access it at [https://explorer.ark.io/](https://explorer.ark.io/).

The feel of the [old explorer](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/old-ark-explorer) is retained in the new version, under the hood things are completely revamped. The frontend of the Explorer itself has been redone using [AngularJS framework](https://angular.io) and [TypeScript programming language](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-explorer.git
cd ark-explorer
npm install
```

You will want to edit the config file [src/app/app.config.ts](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-explorer/blob/master/src/app/app.config.ts) depending on whether you want **MAINNET** or **DEVNET**. If you are pointing your explorer instance to your own ARK node, update the **NODE** property.

#### Custom ARK node

Due to performance factors, the explorer works best when pointing to a specific version of the ARK node **which is not forging**.

Once you have setup your explorer and given it the address for the node API, you will want to go into the ark-node directory and change the branch. On the machine that is running your ARK node, run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/ark-node
git pull
git checkout explorer
```

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`
